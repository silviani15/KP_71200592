Tugu Jogja

Tugu Yogyakarta (Javanese: ꦠꦸꦒꦸꦔꦪꦺꦴꦒꦾꦏꦂꦠ, Tugu Ngayogyakarta) is an important historical landmark in the city of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Tugu means monument, which is usually built as a symbol of an area conceptualising characteristics of that region. Because of its historical background, Tugu Yogyakarta has become a historical icon of the city.

This monument was built by Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono I in 1755. It is known as Tugu Golong-Gilig, and was built in the spirit of people's unity. The top of the monument is round (golong) and the pole is cylindrical (gilig), hence the name. The height of the monument is 25 meters. It was built on the Yogyakarta Imaginary Line that connects the southern sea, Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat Palace, and Mount Merapi. During his meditation, it is said that the Sultan of Yogyakarta used this monument as a benchmark to face the peak of Mount Merapi.

The monument collapsed during a major earthquake on June 10, 1867. In 1889, the Dutch colonial government renovated the monument with a square shape. The top of the monument was built as conical instead of previous round shape, with a small ball at the tip. The height of the monument also reduced from 25 meters to 15 meters. Since then, this monument is also known at the time as De Witte Paal (The White Monument).
