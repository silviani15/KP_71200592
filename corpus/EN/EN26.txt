Mount Merapi

Mount Merapi (peak elevation 2,930 masl, as of 2010) (Javanese: ꦒꦸꦤꦸꦁꦩꦼꦫꦥꦶ, translit. Gunung Mêrapi) is a volcano in the central part of Java Island and is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. The southern slope is within the administration of Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, and the rest is within the territory of Central Java Province, namely Magelang Regency on the west side, Boyolali Regency on the north and east sides, and Klaten Regency on the southeast side. The forest area around its summit has become the Mount Merapi National Park since 2004.

This mountain has a high potential for disaster because according to modern records, Mount Merapi has erupted every two to five years and is surrounded by dense settlements. Since 1548, the mountain has erupted 68 times. Magelang and Yogyakarta are the closest major cities, less than 30 km from the peak. On its slopes there are still settlements up to 1,700 meters high and only four kilometers from the summit. Due to its importance, Merapi is one of the sixteen volcanoes in the world included in the Decade Volcanoes project.

The name "Merapi" comes from the abbreviation of "meru" (transl har. 'mountain') and "api", so the name "merapi" already means "mountain of fire". In old manuscripts, Merapi was once known as Mandrageni.

A group of people observe the damage to buildings caused by the 1930 eruption of Mount Merapi. Since 1768, more than 80 eruptions have been recorded on the mountain. Among these eruptions, the major eruptions (VEI ≥ 3) are the 19th century period (eruptions in 1768, 1822, 1849, 1872) and the 20th century period, 1930-1931. The 19th century eruptions were relatively larger in intensity, while the 20th century eruptions were more frequent. Major eruptions are likely to occur once every 100 years. The 19th century eruption was much larger than the 20th century eruption, where the hot clouds reached 20 kilometers from the summit. Merapi's activity in the 20th century occurred at least 28 times, where the largest eruption occurred in 1931. It has been three quarters of a century since there was a major eruption.

Eruption 2006, In April and May 2006, signs began to appear that Merapi would erupt again, characterized by earthquakes and deformation. The local governments of Central Java and Yogyakarta had prepared evacuation efforts. Instructions had also been issued by both local governments for people living near Merapi to evacuate to designated places.

On May 15, 2006 Merapi finally erupted. Then on June 4, it was reported that the activity of Mount Merapi had exceeded the alert status. Head of BPPTK Yogyakarta Special Region, Ratdomo Purbo explained that around June 2-4, the volume of lava in Merapi's dome had reached 4 million cubic meters - meaning that the lava had filled the entire capacity of Merapi's dome so that the latest additional lava bursts would come straight out of Merapi's dome.

The first eruption occurred at around 5:02 pm on October 26, 2010. There were at least three eruptions. The eruption spewed volcanic material as high as approximately 1.5 km and was accompanied by the release of hot clouds that hit Kaliadem, Kepuharjo Village, Cangkringan District, Sleman. and killed 43 people, plus a baby from Magelang who died from respiratory problems.

Since then, hot clouds have been spewing irregularly. Starting on October 28, Mount Merapi spewed incandescent lava that appeared almost simultaneously with the release of hot clouds at 19:54 WIB. Furthermore, a still fire was observed at the summit on November 1, marking a new phase that magma had reached the crater hole.

Activity 2018-2021, Increased volcanic activity has again been shown by this mountain since Friday, May 11, 2018, at 07.30 WIB. Despite its normal status, Mount Merapi emitted a rumbling sound accompanied by soaring smoke. This phreatic type eruption (blowing) raises smoke as high as up to 5,500 vertical meters. This eruption was witnessed at close range by climbers who were still in the Pasarbubrah area and documented in videos on social media. There were no reports of deaths of climbers. Pasarbubrah area is where Merapi climbers usually stay and set up tents before climbing to the summit. A thin ash rain fell on the western slopes.
