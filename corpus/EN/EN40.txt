Rendang

Rendang or Randang/Rondang in Minangkabau is a meat-based Minangkabau cuisine originating from West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is a preparation of meat (usually beef or buffalo) or eggs cooked at low temperature for a long time using various spices and coconut milk. The cooking process takes many hours (usually around four hours) until all that remains are dark black pieces of meat and bran. At room temperature, rendang can last for weeks. Rendang that has been cooked for a shorter period of time and the sauce has not dried out is called kalio, which is light golden brown in color.

Rendang can be found in Padang restaurants around the world. It is popular in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines and Thailand. In its native Minangkabau region, rendang is served at various traditional ceremonies and special events. Although rendang is a traditional Minangkabau dish, cooking techniques as well as the choice and use of spices vary by region.

In 2011, rendang was named the number one dish on CNN International's list of World's 50 Most Delicious Foods. In 2018, rendang was officially designated as one of Indonesia's five national dishes.

Rendang is a dish that is rich in spices. In addition to the meat base, rendang uses coconut milk (karambia), and a mixture of various mashed spices including chili (lado), lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, ginger, garlic, shallots, and various other spices that are usually referred to as cookers. The uniqueness of rendang is the use of natural spices, which are antiseptic and kill pathogenic bacteria, thus acting as natural preservatives. Garlic, shallots, ginger and galangal are known to have strong antimicrobial activity. It is no surprise that rendang can be stored for a week to four weeks.

The process of cooking authentic rendang can take hours (usually around four hours), which is why it requires time and patience. Pieces of meat are cooked together with spices and coconut milk in the right heat, stirring gently until the coconut milk and spices are absorbed by the meat. After boiling, the heat is turned down and stirred continuously until the coconut milk thickens and becomes dry. Cooking rendang requires patience and care, always carefully turning the dish over and over so that the coconut milk dries out and the spices are fully absorbed, without scorching or destroying the meat. This cooking process is known in modern culinary arts as 'caramelization'. Because it uses many different types of spices, rendang is known to have a complex and unique flavor.

The origin of rendang is traced back to Minangkabau, West Sumatra. For the Minang people, rendang has been around for a long time and has become a traditional dish that is served in various traditional events and daily meals. As a traditional dish, rendang is thought to have been born since the Minang people held their first traditional event. The art of cooking then spread to other Malay-cultured overseas regions; from Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, to the overseas country of Negeri Sembilan where many Minangkabau migrants live. That's why rendang is widely known both in Sumatra and Peninsular Malaya.

Andalas University historian Prof. Dr. Gusti Asnan suspects that rendang has been a widespread dish since Minang people started migrating and sailing to Malacca for trade in the early 16th century. "Since the journey was through the river and took a long time, rendang might have been the right choice at that time as provisions." This is because dried rendang is very durable and can be stored for months, making it the perfect stocking stuffer when migrating or on a trade trip.

Rendang became known and widespread far beyond its original region thanks to the Minangkabau culture of migration. In addition to working as employees or trading, many Minangkabau people are entrepreneurs who open Padang restaurants throughout the archipelago, even extending to neighboring countries to Europe and America. It was these restaurants that introduced rendang and other Minangkabau dishes widely. The fame of rendang has led to it being named the number one dish on CNN International's 2011 list of World's 50 Most Delicious Foods.
