Easter

Easter (Latin: Páscha, Greek: Πάσχα, Paskha; Aramaic: פַּסחא Pasḥa; from Hebrew: פֶּסַח Pesaḥ) is the most important celebration in the Christian ecclesiastical liturgical year. For Christians, Easter is synonymous with Jesus, whom Paul called the "Passover lamb"; Christians to this day believe that Jesus was crucified, died and was buried on Friday afternoon, and on the third day rose from the dead on Sunday morning. Easter celebrates the resurrection and is the most important festival because it commemorates the most sacred event in Jesus' life, as recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament. It is also called Easter Sunday, Resurrection Day, or Resurrection Sunday.

Easter also refers to a period in the church calendar called the Easter Season, which used to be celebrated for forty days from Easter Sunday (the culmination of Holy Week) to the Ascension of Jesus but is now extended to fifty days, until Pentecost (which means "fiftieth day" - the 50th day after Easter, when the Holy Spirit descended). The first week of Easter is called the Easter Octave by the Roman Catholic Church. Easter Day also ends the celebration of Lent, which begins forty days before Maundy Thursday, a time of prayer, penitence, and preparation for mourning.

Easter is one of the holidays that changes its date (in Christianity it is called a shifting feast) because it corresponds to a specific day (in this case Sunday), not a specific date in the civil calendar. Other Christian holidays have their dates adjusted to the Easter day using a complex formula. Easter is usually celebrated between late March and late April (Western rite Christianity) or early April to early May (Eastern rite Christianity) each year, depending on the lunar cycle. After hundreds of years of churches not coming to an agreement, today all churches have accepted the calculations of the Church of Alexandria (now called the Coptic Church) which determine that Easter falls on the first Sunday after the Easter Full Moon, that is the first full moon whose fourteenth day (the ecclesiastical "full moon") falls on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastical vernal equinox).

Easter Sunday is not the same celebration (but is related) as the Jewish Passover (Hebrew: פסח or Pesakh) in terms of symbolism and dating. Indonesian does not have different terms for Passover Pesakh (Jewish) and Easter Paskha (Christian) as some European languages have two different terms, therefore the word Easter can have two different meanings in Indonesian.

Many cultural elements, including the Easter bunny, Easter eggs, and sending Easter cards have become part of modern Easter celebrations, and they are commonly celebrated by Christians and non-Christians alike.

Easter is the oldest celebration in the Christian church, connecting the Old and New Testaments. Pope Leo the Great (440-461) emphasized the importance of Easter and called it festum festorum - the festival of festivals, and said that Christmas was only celebrated to prepare for Easter.

Since Easter is celebrated by Christian churches with a sacrament of the Eucharist or Holy Communion, the sacrament may also be referred to as the Christian Easter Supper, or Good Friday Holy Communion, which differs from the Jewish Passover Supper. Many Christian churches today celebrate the meal more than once a year so that church members are always reminded of the Easter event.

The early church commemorated the resurrection of Jesus with a simple meal and prayer. Later in his missionary journeys, Paul continued to remind the early church of the importance of Jesus' resurrection and Jesus' words at the Last Supper. The earliest source to write about Easter was Melito of Sardis who wrote a homily entitled Peri Pascha (On Easter). The Christians of that era traced the way of the cross (Via Dolorosa) traveled by the Lord Jesus. His death is commemorated as a sacrifice of salvation in the Jewish tradition (Hebrew: Zerah Shelamin).

In Christian churches, especially the Latin Rite, the celebration begins on Good Friday. Churches usually hold services on this day. Roman Catholics usually also fast on this day. The mass is overwhelmed with feelings of sorrow as it commemorates the agony of Jesus' suffering and death on the cross. Protestant churches usually continue the service with the sacrament of Easter Communion to commemorate Jesus' Last Supper. Sad songs such as "Don't Forget Gethsemane" are also sung. The priest or pastor sometimes gives a short sermon. The Roman Catholic Church does not celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist on this day. Under normal circumstances the Sacraments of Confession and Anointing of the Sick are also not offered. (for more details see Good Friday).

On Saturday, Catholic churches and some Anglican and Lutheran churches also hold Easter evening services. During the service, an Easter candle is lit to symbolize the risen Christ; the Exultet or Easter proclamation is sung. Bible verses from the Old Testament that recount the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and prophecies about the Messiah are read. This part of the service culminates with the singing of the Gloria and Alleluia, and the Gospel of the resurrection story is read. Just like the Good Friday service, the priest or pastor sometimes also delivers a sermon after the Bible reading. For the Roman Catholic church, this night is usually also used for the sacrament of holy baptism, the night of receiving new church members. For other members of the congregation. They also receive the sprinkling of holy water as a symbol of renewal of their faith. The service in Roman Catholic churches is then followed by the sacrament of Confirmation. The service then ends with the sacrament of Eucharist. This Easter eve service has many variations.

Easter Eggs Since eggs are not allowed to be eaten during Lent, they are again eaten together on Easter, and were originally colored red to symbolize the joy of Easter. This tradition is found not only in Latin, but also Oriental churches. The symbolic meaning linking eggs to the new birth is thought to have been invented long after the tradition existed. This tradition is thought to have originated from/been influenced by paganism. In some countries, godparents give Easter eggs to their godchildren. The colored eggs are usually used as children's toys. In the United States there is a popular game known as "egg-picking". Other games include "egg-rolling" which children do on Easter Monday on the White House lawn in Washington. The Easter bunny is a pagan symbol and has always been a symbol of fertility.
