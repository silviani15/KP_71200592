Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia

The Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic worldwide. The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first positive case of Covid-19 in Indonesia was detected on March 2, 2020, when two people were confirmed infected from a Japanese national. 

By April 9, the pandemic had spread to 34 provinces with DKI Jakarta, West Java and Central Java as the most exposed provinces to SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia. On July 13, 2020, the number of recoveries exceeded the number of actively exposed cases for the first time.

As of March 25, 2023, Indonesia has reported 6,743,607 positive cases ranking first in Southeast Asia. In terms of mortality, Indonesia ranks third in Asia with 160,994 deaths. However, the mortality rate is estimated to be much higher than the reported data due to non-counting of death cases with acute Covid-19 symptoms that have not been confirmed or tested. 

The Indonesian government has tested 74,941,831 people out of a total population of 269 million, which means only about 277,353 people per one million population. Meanwhile, an announced 6,578,261 people have been cured, leaving 4,352 cases being treated. 

On January 13, 2021, President Joko Widodo received the Covid-19 vaccine at the State Palace, marking the start of the Covid-19 vaccination program in Indonesia. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 is much lower than SARS in 2003, but the transmission is much greater, with a significant number of total deaths.

World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sent a letter to President Joko Widodo on March 10, 2020, requesting that countries with large populations, such as Indonesia, focus more on increasing laboratory capacity to detect coronavirus cases. Early detection is an important factor in overcoming the spread of coronavirus so that authorities can identify clusters more quickly. Several suggestions were made to WHO, namely improving emergency response mechanisms, including asking Indonesia to immediately declare a national emergency situation, educating the public and communicating actively by implementing appropriate risk communication, as well as further improving the community, more intensively tracking positive cases of Covid-19, decentralizing laboratories so that response teams can be mapped clusters and distribution, and can share detailed data on Indonesia's approach and government steps in conducting surveillance and inspection, including contact identification data of patients and a summary of Covid-19 patient contact tracing data.

In order to minimize the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the national economy, the Government of Indonesia on February 25, 2020 issued a stimulus policy of Rp10.3 trillion to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax reductions. The funds were given to provide discounted ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, namely Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which are valid from March to May 2020. Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium service by 48%, and full service by 45%. Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus funds came from the State Budget (APBN) amounting to IDR 443.39 billion for a discount value of 30% and 25% of passengers per aircraft. In addition, there are additional ticket discounts borne by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II amounting to Rp100 billion and PT Pertamina amounting to Rp260 billion through fuel price discounts, so that the total ticket price stimulus is Rp960 billion so that ticket prices can be discounted by 50%.
