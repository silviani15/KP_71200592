Mount Agung

Mount Agung is the highest mountain on the island of Bali with an altitude of 3,142 meters above sea level. It is located in Rendang sub-district, Karangasem Regency, Bali, Indonesia. Besakih Temple, which is one of the most important temples in Bali, is located on the slopes of this mountain.Mount Agung is a stratovulkan type volcano, it has a very large and very deep crater that occasionally emits smoke and water vapor. From Besakih Temple the mountain appears to be a perfectly pointed cone, but actually the summit is elongated and ends in a wide, circular crater.

From the summit of Mount Agung we can see the peak of Mount Rinjani on the island of Lombok to the east, although both mountains are obscured by clouds as both peaks are above the clouds, the Nusa Penida archipelago to the south and its beaches, including Sanur beach and the Batur mountain and lake to the northwest.

1808 In that year Mount Agung threw up a tremendous amount of ash and pumice. 1821 Mount Agung erupted again. The eruption was described as normal but no details were given. The eruption was also considered less violent than the eruption in 1808.

1843 Mount Agung erupted again in 1843, preceded by a number of earthquakes, then spewed volcanic ash, sand and pumice as recorded in a report by Heinrich Zollinger:

"After a long period of inactivity, this year the mountain came to life again. In the first days of activity, earthquake shocks were felt followed by an outpouring of ash, sand and rock."

Mount Agung erupted from February 1963 to January 1964. On February 18, 1963, local residents heard a loud eruption and saw thick smoke coming vertically from the top of Mount Agung. This eruption released hot ash and gas nearly 20,000 meters high. This material reduced sunlight and made the air temperature in the stratosphere drop by 6 °C (10.8 °F). Between 1963 and 1966, the average temperature in the northern hemisphere dropped by 0.4°C. Sulfur ash from the eruption flew around the world and traces of it were visible as sulfuric acid in the Greenland ice sheet.

On February 24, 1963, lava began flowing down from the northern part of the mountain. The lava continued to flow for 20 days and reached a distance of up to 7 km.

On March 17, 1963, Mount Agung erupted with an Eruption Index of VEI 5 (equivalent to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius) and erupted again on May 17, 1963. The number of deaths caused by the whole process of Mount Agung eruption reached 1,148 people with 296 people injured.

This eruption was recorded by Ida Pedanda Made Sidemen in the lontar colophon 'Pūjā Pañambutan' which he copied with a pangéling-éling (reminder message) about the 1963 eruption of Mount Agung, followed by the political turmoil of 1965.

Mount Agung on November 27, 2017
In September 2017, increased rumbling and seismic activity around the volcano raised the normal status to alert and around 122,500 people were evacuated from their homes around the volcano. The National Disaster Management Agency declared a 12-kilometer exclusion zone around the volcano on 24 September.

On September 18, 2017, Mount Agung's status was raised from Alert to Standby. Evacuations gathered in sports halls and other community buildings around Klungkung, Karangasem, Buleleng and other areas. The monitoring station is located in Tembuku, Rendang, Karangasem Regency, where the intensity and frequency of tremors are monitored for signs of an impending eruption.

On September 22, 2017, Mount Agung's status was raised from Alert to Awas. The area experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes on September 25, and 300 to 400 earthquakes by midday on 26 September. Seismologists have been concerned with the strength and frequency of incidents as it has taken fewer similar volcanoes to erupt.

In late October 2017, the status was downgraded from Awas to Alert. The volcano's activity decreased significantly, which led to the lowering of the highest emergency status on 29 October.

There was a small phreatic eruption reported on November 21, 2017, at 5:05 pm with the volcanic ash column reaching 3,842 meters (12,605 ft) above sea level. Thousands of people immediately fled the area, and more than 29,000 temporary refugees were reported living in more than 270 locations nearby.

A magmatic eruption began on Saturday, November 25, 2017. The resulting violent eruption reportedly rose about 1.5-4 km above the summit crater, drifting southward and dusting the surrounding area with a dark layer of thin ash, which caused several airlines to cancel flights bound for Australia and New Zealand. The official danger level remains at 3, with residents advised to stay 7.5 km away from the crater. So far the eruptions appear moderate, with the possibility of more intensive eruptions in the near future. An orange glow was later observed around the crater at night, suggesting that fresh magma had indeed reached the surface. On November 26, 2017, at 23:37 WITA, a second eruption occurred. This was the second eruption to erupt in less than a week.

On March 10, 2018, the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) downgraded the status of Mount Agung, Karangasem, from level IV (Alert) to level III (Standby). This status change was announced directly by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Ignasius Jonan.

On April 11, 2018 at 09:04 WITA, Mount Agung again spewed volcanic ash as high as 500 meters. The column of gray smoke and ash was seen leaning towards the southwest.

On June 28, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. WITA, Mount Agung emitted smoke until Friday morning which caused ash rain in the west to southwest and caused Ngurah Rai International Airport, Banyuwangi Airport and Jember Airport to be officially closed from Friday at 3:00 a.m. WITA to 7:00 p.m. WITA following the continuous eruption of Mount Agung which emitted volcanic smoke and ash.

On July 2, 2018 at 21:04 WITA, Mount Agung erupted again. This time by throwing lava with a radius of 2 km. The eruption occurred in a strombolian manner with a boom sound. The term strombolian type is taken from the word stromboli, the name of a volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli located in the Thyrene Sea, Mediterranean. The characteristics of strombolian eruptions are the presence of small eruptions of gas and fragments or fragments of magma. In the PVMBG report of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the eruption of Mount Agung occurred on July 2 and July 3, 2018 at 04:13 Wita. The height of the ash column in the night eruption was observed ±2,000 m above the peak (±5,142 m above sea level). The ash column was observed to be gray in color with thick intensity leaning towards the west. The status of Mount Agung remains at level 3 or alert with a danger radius of 4 kilometers from the crater.

Balinese Hindus believe that Mount Agung is the abode of the gods, and also believe that there is a divine palace on the mountain. Therefore, the Balinese people make this place a sacred place that is sanctified. Besakih Temple, which is located at the foot of Mount Agung, was also spared from the lava flow of the 1963 eruption of Mount Agung. People believe that the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963 was a warning from the Gods. In historical records, Besakih Temple and Mount Agung became the foundation of the creation of Balinese society. Quoting the book Custodian of the Sacred Mountains: Culture and Society on the Island of Bali by Thomas A Reuter, said that Maharesi Markandeya, the first person to lead Majapahit's escape to Bali, only managed to settle in Bali coming to the foot of Mount Agung. Previously, the exodus wave led by Markandeya numbered 800 people, most of whom died from disease outbreaks.
