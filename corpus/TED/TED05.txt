Van Boeckholzt first reported the location of Ratu Boko in 1790 and mentioned that there were ancient ruins on Ratu Boko Hill. This hill itself is a branch of the Sewu mountain range that stretches from southern Yogyakarta to the Tulungagung area. One hundred years later, research was conducted by FDK Bosch who reported on the Keraton van Ratoe Boko. It was concluded that the ruins were the remains of a palace.

According to author HJ. DeGraff, in the 17th century many European travelers came to Java saying that there were archaeological sites related to Raja Boko. In 1790, Dutch scientist Van Boeckholtz was the first to discover archaeological ruins on Ratu Boko hill. The hill itself is the northwestern branch of the larger Sewu Mountains, located in the southern part of Central Java and East Java, stretching from Yogyakarta to Tulungagung. The publication of this discovery attracted explorers such as Mackenzie, Junghun and Brumun to investigate and explore the site in 1814. In the early 20th century, the Ratu Boko site was studied extensively by researcher FDK Bosch who published his findings in a report entitled "Keraton Van Ratoe Boko". The report concluded that the ruins were the remains of a palace. During his investigation, Mackenzie also found statues of a man and woman with golden heads embracing each other. Stone pillars decorated with zoomorphic figures such as elephants, horses, etc were also found among the ruins.
