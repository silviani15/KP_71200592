Pura as a word comes from the Sanskrit 'puri' or 'puram' which means gate, for example 'angkasapura' which is often found at airports and means the gate of space. But in Bali the word pura refers to a place of worship and puri means a beautiful building where kings live.

As a place of worship, Balinese temples differ from Indian Hindu temples in terms of design, being open building areas surrounded by walls. Each open area is connected by a carved gate. The contents of the open area or temple courtyard contain several buildings, namely the pelinggih where the creator resides, meru which is a stacked roof, and bale or pavilion. The concept of trimandala is applied in temple buildings, where each building has a different level of sanctity, namely nista mandala followed by madya mandala, and main mandala which is the innermost place or innards.

Nista mandala is at the outermost part and is the entrance to the temple. In this zone or area there is a field that is used for dance performances as well as being used for the preparation of religious ceremonies.
