Located in the city of Yogyakarta, the Ngyogyakarta Hadiningrat Palace or Yogyakarta Palace is the official palace of the Vuaogyakarta Hadiningrat Kingdom. The palace was founded in 1755 by Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana I under the name Istana/Keraton Yogyakarta, newly established after the breakup of Islamic Mataram by the Giyanti agreement. The palace was a fragment of Surakarta Hadiningrat Palace in Surakarta Islamic Mataram (Surakarta Kingdom). Thus the Mataram Dynasty was continued by 2 kingdoms, namely the Sultanate of Yogyakarta and the Sultanate of Surakarta. The total area of Yogyakarta Palace is 184 hectares which includes the entire complex of Baluwart Fort, North Square, South Square, Gladak Gate, and Yogyakarta Great Mosque. While the area of the palace (keraton core) is 13 hectares.

Although the Sultanate of Yogyakarta officially became part of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia in 1945, the palace building complex still functions as the residence of the Sultan and his palace, continuing the Sultanate's traditions to this day. The palace is now also one of Yogyakarta's tourist attractions. Some of the palace complexes are museums that hold various sultanate collections, including various gifts from European kings, replicas of palace heirlooms, and gamelan. Architecturally, the palace is one of the best examples of Javanese palace architecture with its lavish halls and spacious courts and pavilions.
