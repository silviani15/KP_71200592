In 1755, Tugu Jogja Monument was built by Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono I. Known as Golong-Gilig Monument, it was built with the spirit of human unity. The top of the monument is round (golong) and the pole is cylindrical (gilig), as the name suggests. The height of the monument is 25 meters. It was built on the Yogyakarta Imaginary Line that connects the South Sea, Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat Palace, and Mount Merapi. In his meditation, the Sultan of Yogyakarta at that time is said to have used this monument as a reference to the top of Mount Merapi.

The monument collapsed during the great earthquake of June 10, 1867. In 1889, the Dutch East Indies colonial government restored the monument into a square shape. The top of the monument was built in the shape of a cone, with a small ball at the end, instead of the previous round shape. The height of the monument was also reduced from 25 meters to 15 meters. Since then the monument has also been known as De Witte Paal (White Monument).
