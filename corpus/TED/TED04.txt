This road connects Tugu Yogyakarta with the Yogyakarta Palace Complex. On the north side is Jalan Margo Utomo which stretches from the Tugu area in the south to Yogyakarta Station in the east. Between Jalan Margo Utomo and Jalan Malioboro is separated by a unique horizontal line that uses sliding doors.

Previously, this intersection could be crossed by public transportation from Jalan Margo Utomo to Malioboro. But as more and more vehicles passed through, only small vehicles such as pedestrians or bicycles could cross this intersection, while other vehicles had to turn east first through Kewek Bridge, then west through Jalan Abu Bakar Ali, then Jalan Malioboro.

In the 1980s and later, the first building south of the railroad tracks - or even the last building in Malioboro - had cigarette advertisements advertising Marlboro cigarettes, which certainly attracted both locals and foreigners who noticed the play on words with a street name advertising a foreign product.
