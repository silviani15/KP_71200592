Prambanan Temple is one of the most beautiful temples in Southeast Asia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia. The architecture of the building is tall and slender, generally in harmony with Hindu architecture, where Shiva Temple as the main temple, reaching 47 meters in height, is located in the middle of a complex of smaller temples. One of the grandest temples in Southeast Asia, Prambanan Temple attracts tourists from all over the world.

Javanese people in the surrounding villages knew about the temple ruins even before the temple was officially rediscovered, but they did not know its historical background: which kingdom ruled or which king ordered the construction of the monument. Therefore, the locals developed stories and legends to explain the origin of the temple, which is filled with legends about giants and cursed princesses. They recount the wondrous origins of Prambanan and Sewu; in the legend of Rara Jonggrang, many demons were created by the temples on the orders of Bandung Bondowoso.
