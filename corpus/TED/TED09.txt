A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking some or all of the Sun's view from a small portion of the Earth's surface. This alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season at the new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the Earth's orbital plane. During a total solar eclipse, the Sun's disk is completely covered by the Moon. In partial and ring eclipses, only part of the Sun is covered. Unlike a lunar eclipse that can be seen from anywhere on the night side, a solar eclipse can only be seen from a relatively small area of the Earth. So while a total solar eclipse occurs on average every 18 months somewhere on Earth, it only happens once every 360-410 years in a particular location. 

If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and on the same orbital plane as the Earth, a total solar eclipse would occur once a month, on each new moon. In contrast, since the Moon's orbital inclination is about 5 degrees with respect to the Earth, its shadow does not usually fall on the Earth. Therefore, solar eclipses (and lunar eclipses) only occur during the eclipse, resulting in at least two to five solar eclipses per year, with a maximum of two. Total eclipses are less common as they require a more precise alignment of the centers of the Sun and Moon, and the size of the Moon visible in the sky is sometimes too small to cover the Sun completely.
