The ongoing disease worldwide is the Covid-19 pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the disease. The first positive case of Covid-19 in Indonesia was detected on March 2, 2020, when two people were confirmed infected from a Japanese national.

By April 9, the covid 19 pandemic had spread to 34 provinces in Indonesia, with DKI Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java being the most vulnerable provinces to SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia. The number of recoveries surpassed the number of active cases for the first time on July 13, 2020.

As of March 25, 2023, there were 6,743,607 confirmed cases in Indonesia, making Indonesia the first highest in Southeast Asia. Indonesia is third in Asia with 160,994 deaths. However, the mortality rate is estimated to be much higher than the reported data as it excludes deaths with acute symptoms of Covid-19 that have not been confirmed or tested.
