Saturn's interior is believed to consist of a core containing iron, nickel, and rocks (compounds of silicon and oxygen). The core is surrounded by an inner layer of metallic hydrogen, a middle layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to the ammonia crystals that fill its upper atmosphere. The electric currents contained in its metallic hydrogen layer are thought to produce Saturn's magnetic field, which is known to be weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Electric currents contained in its hydrogen metal layer are thought to produce Saturn's magnetic field, which is known to be weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is only about 1/20th that of Jupiter. Although the appearance of the outer atmosphere appears normal, what fills this atmospheric layer are long-lived properties. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach up to 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), which is faster than Jupiter's wind speed, but not as high as Neptune's. 

Saturn is famous for its unique ring system, which consists mainly of icy particles with a small amount of rocky and dusty debris. At least 82 natural satellites orbit Saturn, 53 of which have been given official names; this number does not include the hundreds of small natural satellites in the ring system. Titan, Saturn's largest natural satellite and the second largest natural satellite in the Solar System, is larger in diameter than Mercury but less massive than Mercury. Titan is also the only natural satellite in the solar system with a thick atmosphere.
